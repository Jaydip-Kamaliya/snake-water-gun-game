# Snake-Water-Gun-game

## Description
This is my first Python project. It is a simple command-line game called "Snake, Water, Gun". It is similar to the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The user plays against the computer, and the game continues until the user decides to quit. The final scores are displayed at the end of the game. The game logic is implemented in Python.

## Features
- Simple command-line interface
- Randomized computer moves
- Score tracking for user and computer
- Option to quit the game at any time
- Displays final scores at the end of the game
- Easy to understand game logic
